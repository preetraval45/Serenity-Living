# Email Configuration Guide

## Overview
The contact and tour booking forms will:
1. ‚úÖ Save submissions to PostgreSQL database
2. ‚úÖ Log all submissions to console/logs
3. üìß Send email notifications to **serenitylivingoflexington@gmail.com** (when configured)

Email notifications are **optional** - forms will work without email configuration, but you won't receive email alerts.

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication (if not already enabled)

## Important Notes

### Email is Optional
- Forms will work WITHOUT email configuration
- Submissions are ALWAYS saved to the database
- Submissions are ALWAYS logged to console
- Email is just an additional notification layer

### Security
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER commit your App Password to Git**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è The `.env.local` file is git-ignored for security
- ‚úÖ Store passwords in environment variables only
- ‚úÖ Use different App Passwords for dev and production

### Troubleshooting

#### "Email sending failed" in logs but form works
- ‚úÖ This is okay! Form submission succeeded and saved to database
- Check if environment variables are set correctly
- Verify App Password is valid (no spaces, 16 characters)
- Check Gmail security settings

#### Emails not being received
1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify App Password is correct
3. Check Vercel environment variables are set
4. View Vercel function logs for errors
5. Ensure 2FA is enabled on Gmail account

#### "Invalid credentials" error
- Generate a new App Password
- Make sure you're using the App Password, not your regular Gmail password
- Remove any spaces from the password string

## Alternative: View Submissions Without Email

If you prefer not to set up email, you can view submissions by:

### Option 1: Check Database Directly
```bash
# Connect to your database
psql "your-database-connection-string"

# View contact submissions
SELECT * FROM contact_submissions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

# View tour bookings
SELECT * FROM tour_bookings ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Option 2: Check Vercel Logs
All submissions are logged to Vercel function logs with full details.

### Option 3: Build Admin Dashboard (Future)
You can create an admin page in your Next.js app to view submissions.
